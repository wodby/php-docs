| [Apache](containers/apache.md) | [Apache HTTP server](https://httpd.apache.org) is the most popular web server, developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation. |
| [PHP](containers/php.md) | Currently two mainlines of [PHP 7](http://php.net) are supported: 7.0 and 7.1. PHP container comes with a handful of most popular extensions and also includes [Drush](http://drush.org) and [Drupal Console](https://drupalconsole.com). |

It typically speeds up delivery with a factor of 300 - 1000x, depending on your architecture. |
| [Solr](containers/solr.md) | [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr) is a search engine built on Apache Lucene. Its major features include full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, real-time indexing, dynamic clustering, database integration. |
