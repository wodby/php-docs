# Nginx

[Nginx environment variables](https://github.com/wodby/nginx#environment-variables)

##### Extra PHP endpoint

For security reasons, default nginx config allows executing limited php endpoints. This is how you can add addition php endpoint:

1. Add *.conf file to your codebase with locations definition, example:
```
location = /custom-php-endpoint.php {
    fastcgi_pass php;
}
```
2. In nginx service configuration set new environment variable `NGINX_SERVER_EXTRA_CONF_FILEPATH` to your *.conf file (e.g. `/var/www/html/drupal.conf`). It will be included at the end of `/etc/nginx/conf.d/drupal.conf`
3. Restart the service

##### Extra XML endpoint

By default nginx config requests Drupal backend when `rss.xml` or `sitemap.xml` requested. If you want to add another XML endpoint generated by Drupal just set environment variable `NGINX_ALLOW_XML_ENDPOINTS` to any value and restart the service.

##### Additional configuration

If the default drupal config and available environment variables are not enough for your customizations you can replace the config with your own:
1. Copy `/etc/nginx/conf.d/drupal.conf` to your codebase, adjust to your needs
2. Deploy code with your config file
3. Add new environment variable `NGINX_CONF_INCLUDE` for nginx service, the value should the path to your *.conf file (e.g. `/var/www/html/nginx.conf`
