# Rsyslog

Rsyslog can be used to stream your applications logs (watchdog). It's similar to using syslog, however there's no syslog in [PHP container](#php) (one process per container). Rsyslog will stream all incoming logs to a container output.

Here how you can use it with Monolog:

1. Install [monolog module](https://www.drupal.org/project/monolog). Make sure all dependencies being downloaded
2. Add new handler at `monolog/monolog.services.yml`:
```yml
monolog.handler.rsyslog:
  class: Monolog\Handler\SyslogUdpHandler
  arguments: ['rsyslog']
```
3. Rebuild cache (`drush cr`)
4. Use `rsyslog` handler for your channels
5. Find your logs in [rsyslog container output](https://docs.wodby.com/apps/logs.html)
