# Docker for Mac Issues

## Permissions issues

Use `-dev-macos` version of php image where default `wodby` user has `501:20` uid/gid that matches default macOS user. 

## Poor volumes performance

There 2 ways how can improve performance of docker volumes on macOS:

### User-guided Caching

Since Docker for Mac 17.06 there's a new `:cached` option available for volumes. You can find more information about this in [docker blog](https://blog.docker.com/2017/05/user-guided-caching-in-docker-for-mac).

Replace _codebase_ volume definition of _php_ and _nginx_/_apache_ services with the option below marked as "User-guided caching". 

### Docker-sync

The core idea of this project is to use an external volume that will sync your files with a file synchronizer tool.

```bash
$ gem install docker-sync
```

1. Use `docker-sync.yml` file from the [latest stable release](https://github.com/wodby/docker4wordpress/releases)
2. Uncomment _docker-sync_ volume definition in your compose file
3. Replace _volumes_ definition of _php_ and _nginx_/_apache_ services with the option below marked as "Docker-sync".
4. Start docker-sync: `docker-sync start`
5. In a new shell run after you started docker-sync `docker-compose up -d`

Now when you change your code on the host machine docker-sync will sync your data to php and nginx/apache containers.
